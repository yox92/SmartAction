|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Adaptive healing speed**  | Dynamically speeds up or slows down animation and the *tick rate* of consummable/healing effects based on your current **movement state** (Idle / Walk / Sprint). Animation speed is synced to avoid desync. | `SpeedHealing.cs`, `PatchModulateHealSpeed.cs` |
| **Auto‑finish healed limb** | The mod automatically detects when the targeted body part is fully healed and forces the effect to **advance to `Residue`**, preventing wasted ticks.                                                        | `PatchDoMedEffect.cs`                          |
| **Quick‑cancel surgery**    | Double‑right‑click with a CMS or Surv12 kit to instantly **cancel the animation**, fast‑forward the internal state, *and drop the item* so you can keep moving.                                              | `DropSurgery.cs`                               |
| **Move Sprint**             | Can sprint when use consommable / healing. Can walk when surgery                                                                                                                                             | `**Transpiler**.cs`                            |
